Purpose of the Project: CTA Ridership Data Analysis
1. Understanding CTA Ridership Trends
Analyze historical Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) ridership data to identify patterns and trends.
Explore how ridership fluctuates over time (daily, monthly, yearly).
Compare ridership across weekdays, weekends, and holidays.
2. Data Cleaning & Transformation
Handle missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies.
Convert date-related fields into structured components (year, month, day, weekday).
3. Predicting Future Ridership
Train a machine learning model (Linear Regression) to predict future CTA ridership based on historical trends.
Use extracted date-related features to improve forecasting accuracy.
4. Identifying Key Factors Influencing Ridership
Determine if ridership depends on factors like day of the week, seasonality, or time of the year.
Use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize ridership trends.
5. Improving Transportation Planning
Provide insights for CTA officials and city planners to optimize train and bus schedules.
Help manage resources more efficiently based on peak and off-peak times.
6. Enhancing Public Transport Experience
Identify busiest transit days to improve service allocation.
Assist policymakers in making data-driven decisions for public transit improvement.
7. Future Scope
Integrate external factors: Weather, holidays, or special events.
Apply advanced models: Time-series forecasting (ARIMA, LSTM) for long-term predictions.
Expand to other datasets: Analyze bus vs. train ridership for deeper insights.
